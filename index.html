    />
    <p>
      The Motorola Razr 5G, released in 2020, is the second-generation version
      of Motorola's modern take on its iconic Razr flip phone. This updated
      model brings 5G connectivity, better performance, and various improvements
      in design and usability over the first Razr foldable. Hereâ€™s a detailed
      overview of its key features: <br>

      <h3>ðŸ”·Design & Build </h3>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Form Factor:</strong> The Razr 5G
      maintains the classic clamshell design with a foldable display. When
      closed, itâ€™s compact and pocket-friendly, and when unfolded, it reveals a
      full smartphone-sized display. <br>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Materials:</strong> It has a stainless steel frame
      with a glass front and back, making it sleek and durable. <br>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Dimensions:</strong> When
      unfolded, it measures 6.9 inches tall, and when folded, it's a compact
      square. <br>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Colors:</strong> Available in several color options including Polished
      Graphite, Blush Gold, and Liquid Mercury. 

      <h3>ðŸ”·Display </h3>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Main Display:</strong> A 6.2-inch
      P-OLED foldable display with a resolution of 876 x 2142 pixels. It offers
      vibrant colors and deep contrasts typical of OLED screens, and the
      flexible nature of the display allows it to fold in half. <br>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Secondary Display:</strong> Thereâ€™s also a 2.7-inch G-OLED Quick View display on the outside
      (600 x 800 pixels). This external display lets you check notifications,
      control media, take selfies, and interact with apps without unfolding the
      phone. 

      <h3>ðŸ”·Performance </h3>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Processor:</strong> Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G
      chipset, which supports 5G connectivity and offers solid mid-range
      performance for everyday tasks, app usage, and moderate gaming. <br>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹RAM:</strong> Comes
      with 8GB of RAM, which is more than sufficient for smooth multitasking and
      performance. <br>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Storage:</strong> 256GB of internal storage, which is ample for
      storing apps, media, and files. However, there is no microSD card slot for
      storage expansion. <br>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Operating System:</strong> Initially launched with Android 10,
      it has since been updated to Android 11, and features Motorola's
      near-stock Android experience with a few helpful additions like Moto
      Actions.

      <h3>ðŸ”·Camera</h3> 
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Main Camera:</strong> Features a 48 MP primary camera (f/1.7, OIS)
      located on the exterior of the phone. When the phone is folded, this acts
      as the rear camera for standard photography, and when unfolded, it
      functions as a selfie camera through the Quick View display. <br>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Selfie Camera:</strong> Thereâ€™s also a 20 MP internal selfie camera located in a notch at
      the top of the main display for taking selfies when the phone is unfolded.<br>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Camera Features:</strong> The camera supports OIS (Optical Image Stabilization),
      Night Mode, and 4K video recording at 30fps. 

      <h3>ðŸ”·Battery & Charging </h3>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Battery Capacity:</strong> Comes with a 2800mAh battery, which is somewhat small compared

      make the most of it. <br>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Charging:</strong> Supports 15W fast charging via a USB-C
      port, though wireless charging is not supported. While the battery life is
      decent for light to moderate use, it may require a top-up by the end of
      the day for heavy users. 

      <h3>ðŸ”·Connectivity</h3> 
      <strong>ðŸ”¹5G:</strong> Supports 5G networks, though it
      is limited to sub-6 GHz 5G, which offers widespread coverage but not the
      extremely fast speeds of millimeter-wave 5G. <br>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Other Connectivity:</strong> Includes
      Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.1, and NFC for mobile payments. 

      <h3>ðŸ”·Special Features</h3>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Foldable Display:</strong> The folding mechanism has been improved from the
      first-generation Razr, offering a more durable hinge and a smoother
      folding experience. Motorola claims the hinge design reduces creasing on
      the display.<br> 
      <strong>ðŸ”¹Quick View Display:</strong> The external display allows you to reply
      to messages, control music, check notifications, and even use apps without
      opening the phone. <br>
      <strong>ðŸ”¹eSIM and Nano-SIM Support:</strong> Unlike the first model,
      which only had an eSIM, the Razr 5G also offers a nano-SIM slot for added
      flexibility. 

      <h3>ðŸ”·Durability </h3>
      The phone is not officially rated for water or
      dust resistance, but it has a water-repellent coating to protect against
      splashes and light rain. 

      <h3>ðŸ”·Price & Availability </h3>
      ðŸ”¹At launch, the Motorola Razr
      5G was priced at around $1,399, making it a premium device largely due to
      its innovative foldable design.<br>
      ðŸ”¹Over time, the price has decreased,
      especially with newer foldable phones entering the market. 

      <h3>ðŸ”·Competitors</h3> 
      The Razr 5G competes with other foldable phones like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip
      series, though its nostalgic design and external display set it apart.

      <h3>ðŸ”·Summary </h3>
      The Motorola Razr 5G is a stylish, modern take on a nostalgic
      design, offering a unique blend of foldable technology and 5G
      connectivity. It is ideal for users looking for a compact phone with a
      large screen, but its smaller battery and mid-range processor make it best
      suited for moderate users rather than power users or gamers. The Quick
      View display is one of its standout features, allowing users to access
      essential functions without unfolding the device.

      measure around 6.2 inches, with similar specs to the Pixel 8 Pro's OLED
      screen, including a high refresh rate (120Hz) and durable glass (such as
      Gorilla Glass Victus). <br>
      <strong>ðŸ”¸Build Quality:</strong> We can expect a premium metal and
